# petfinder2
Group Project one

This project was a concentrated effort by Vinnie, Brett, Kayvan, and Christian to bring something a little different to the table for the first round of group project ideas.

The team's first inclination was to go about using the Spotify API to get into the 'song recognition" software and see what could be done about locating a concert from said band nearby.

Realizing this was out of scope of the project quickly, we reformed our idea with a fast spitball session, and upon coming to the consensus that there are too many animals in need of a home we decided to make a 'pet finder 2.0'.

//Yes, I realize we just had a shift in point-of-view for this message, but please, just roll with it.

The original Petfinder has a great API, but a horrendous GUI. We thought with a little help we could fix it up a bit and bring it up to today's standards - or at least 2005 ;)

Things we added:

1. Google Maps - i.e. the location of the shelter the animal (result) currently resides.
2. Streamlined Interface - no more busy backgrounds and cluttered screen. TMI is a killer.
3. Fun Bits - See how many times animal categories have been searched for with an easy to read, reactive pie chart.
4. Advertising considerations - placeholder affilliate link carosel on the main page, and disclaimer room on the contact page.

No version notes, as this is basically V 1.0
